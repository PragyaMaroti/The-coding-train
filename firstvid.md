 #### The video's title is : Introduction: GIT and GITHUB for poets.
 In this video, We start from scratch and talk about, What is GIT and Github and  Why is it useful?
 we take a simple text file example to understand the concepts.
 
 #### Why GIT and Github?
 
 Have you ever worked on writing something, maintaining a file and have to make edits again and again, and savethem, revisit them, compare them etc... sounds clumsy and time taking:tired_face:
</br> This is one of the reasons for using GIT, which is callled as __*version control*__.
 GIT keeps track of the history of the things that you have been working upon.
 
 Another important feature that git provides us with is allowing __*collaboration*__
 It provides quite advanced tools for collaboration, which allows a lot many people to work on the same project file together.
 
 Till now, It was all about GIT,  but What's GITHUB?</br>
 GIT is the original software that provides version control features, it can be run on laptop, or anywhere we want.
 GITHUB is the web service where we can have an account and do the GIT things on this server. It runs the GIT software " behind the scenes".
